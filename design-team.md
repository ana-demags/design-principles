## Joel's principles

- Content drives presentation. Form follows function.
- Disagree and commit.
- User research is everyone's responsiblity. We are all advocates for our customers.
- Time is of the essence.
- Prioritize customer problems over theoretical use cases.
- Anything added dilutes everything else.
- Approachable is better than simple.
- Enable workflows with clear objectives.
- Throughput beats perfection.
- Ship the minimum viable change, listen for feedback, and iterate accordingly.
- Focus on removing friction from the workflow.

## Danielle's principles

- The details make the cake. Micro interactions matter.
- "Anyone Can Design" (spoken in the Gaston accent of "Anyone Can Cook") –– as in, great ideas and inspiration can come from anywhere and unexpected places.
- "Whack the moles". We should fix small, easy wins on the spot –– not walk by them.
- The work is never done, but it's good to know when to stop (thanks Zari!).
- Disagree and commit (thanks Joel!).
- Ship it and iterate –– opening the first door will help you figre out what the next doors even are.
- Favor doing over deliberating, trying over deciding, asking for foreginess instead of asking for permission.
- Prototyping is key –– sometimes you have to play with something to know what feels right and what doesn't.

## Zari's principles

- Design is a partner, not a service
- Consistent is better than custom
- Overcommunication is better than ambiguity
- Showing/disabling is better than hiding
- Just because you can, doesn't mean you should
- Never lose sight of the new user when designing for the power user
- The work is never done, but it's good to know when to stop
- Asking questions demonstrates strength, not ignorance
- Accessibility is not optional

## Tim's principles

- Determine user needs first.
- Consistency is key.
- Try things, learn, and iterate later.
- Solicit feedback shamelessly.
- Make (informed) decisions for users.
- Great products offer simplicity and transparency.
- Don't aim for "Wow!" Aim for "Of course!"
- Scalability matters. Design for the future.
- Obvious--and preferably singular--solutions.

## Carlos' principles
- Empower others.
- Take in to consideration your user’s mental model.
- Transparency over ambiguity.
- Fail fast, fail early.
- Aim to minimize the possibility of errors but they are bound to happen, help users overcome them.
- Don’t be afraid of change.
- It's never a bad time for feedback. 

## Desiree's principles
- Strive for intuitive solutions
- Design for everyone, understand accessibility
- Always seek feedback
- Details make the experience
- Be mindful of the design process
- Be consistent, not uniform
