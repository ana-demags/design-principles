## Joel's principles

- Content drives presentation. Form follows function.
- Disagree and commit.
- User research is everyone's responsiblity. We are all advocates for our customers.
- Time is of the essence.
- Prioritize customer problems over theoretical use cases.
- Anything added dilutes everything else.
- Approachable is better than simple.
- Enable workflows with clear objectives.
- Throughput beats perfection.
- Ship the minimum viable change, listen for feedback, and iterate accordingly.
- Focus on removing friction from the workflow.

## Danielle's principles

- Functional is better than perfect.
- The details make the cake. Micro interactions matter.
- Anyone can design (as in, inspiration and great ideas can come from anywhere).
- "Whack the moles". We should fix small, easy wins on the spot –– not walk by them.
- The work is never done, but it's good to know when to stop (thanks Zari!).
- Disagree and commit (thanks Joel!).
- Anything added dilutes everything else.

## Zari's principles

- Design is a partner, not a service
- Consistent is better than custom
- Overcommunication is better than ambiguity
- Showing/disabling is better than hiding
- Just because you can, doesn't mean you should
- Never lose sight of the new user when designing for the power user
- The work is never done, but it's good to know when to stop
- Asking questions demonstrates strength, not ignorance
- Accessibility is not optional

## Tim's principles

- Determine user needs first.
- Consistency is key.
- Try things, learn, and iterate later.
- Solicit feedback shamelessly.
- Make (informed) decisions for users.
- Great products offer simplicity and transparency.
- Don't aim for "Wow!" Aim for "Of course!"
- Scalability matters. Design for the future.
- Obvious--and preferably singular--solutions.

## Desiree's principles
- Strive for intuitive solutions
- Design for everyone, understand accessibility
- Always seek feedback
- Details make the experience
- Be mindful of the design process
- Be consistent, not uniform
