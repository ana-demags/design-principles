## Joel's principles
(*needs some consolidation*) ðŸ™ˆ
- Identify the jobs a feature or workflow needs to solve. Don't give the feature/workflow/UI component too many jobs (keep a relatively simple mapping of job to component).
- Identify constraints and work within them. ("Embrace constraints")
- Always be shipping.
- Iterate often.
- Favor unblocking over blocking.
- Embrace the seasonality of a project process. Take time to listen (research), and time to process and consider. Break the problem wide open. Start with story, and identify/build a clear narrative. Explore designs at the lowest possible fidelity level. Negotiate for alignment and scope. Participate in the build. Guide the ship. Take time to sharpen the saw, rest, and reflect before starting again.
- Design is a communication tool, not just implementation instructions. Use design to drive the conversation, and help people communicate their vision.
- Favor unblocking over blocking. Momentum is precious.
- Disagree and commit.
- Simplify wherever possible. Aim for approachable when simple is not possible.
- Time is of the essence.
- Focus on workflows, not features.
- Workflows happen in the context of story, so be sure to tell the story.
- Show what's possible. Dream big.
- User research is everyone's responsiblity. We are all advocates for our customers.
- Prioritize customers problems over theoretical use cases.
- Anything added dilutes everything else.
- Throughput beats perfection.
- Shorten the journey by removing friction.
- All feedback is a gift.
- Suprise and delight.
- Use whimsey to create a fun space to work.
- Copy is UI too.
- Embrace the journey. The best experiences are often cultivated over time, not simply launched at once.
- Listen carefully to others, listen for their perspective and look at what they are seeing, and include it in your own perspective. Tell a compelling story, and bring everyone along for the ride.

## Danielle's principles

- Functional is better than perfect.
- The details make the cake. Micro interactions matter.
- Anyone can design (as in, inspiration and great ideas can come from anywhere).
- "Whack the moles". We should fix small, easy wins on the spot â€“â€“ not walk by them.
- The work is never done, but it's good to know when to stop (thanks Zari!).
- Disagree and commit (thanks Joel!).
- Anything added dilutes everything else.

## Zari's principles

- Design is a partner, not a service
- Consistent is better than custom
- Overcommunication is better than ambiguity
- Showing/disabling is better than hiding
- Just because you can, doesn't mean you should
- Never lose sight of the new user when designing for the power user
- The work is never done, but it's good to know when to stop
- Asking questions demonstrates strength, not ignorance
- Accessibility is not optional

## Tim's principles

- Determine user needs first.
- Consistency is key.
- Try things, learn, and iterate later.
- Solicit feedback shamelessly.
- Make (informed) decisions for users.
- Great products offer simplicity and transparency.
- Don't aim for "Wow!" Aim for "Of course!"
- Scalability matters. Design for the future.
- Obvious--and preferably singular--solutions.
