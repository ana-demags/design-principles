# Design principles

These principles are meant to help guide and inform design decisions, and how we build and ship product at Apollo. They are about starting from [first principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_principle), and they are the principles we can always go back to and start from.

We initially set out to come up with a list of unified principles for our design group, but during the exercise it became clear that seeing each person's principles was really valuable as a way to understand how each team member sees and thinks. We've decided to list principles in aggregate for now, and someday we may consolidate based on theme.

## Joel's principles

- Content drives presentation. Form follows funtion.
- Disagree and commit.
- User research is everyone's responsiblity. We are all advocates for our customers.
- Time is of the essence.
- Prioritize customer problems over theoretical use cases.
- Anything added dilutes everything else.
- Approachable is better than simple.
- Enable workflows with clear objectives.
- Throughput beats perfection.
- Ship the minimum viable change, listen for feedback, and iterate accordingly.
- Focus on removing friction from the workflow.
